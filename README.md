**Semantic Commit Messages**  <br />
    See how a minor change to your commit message style can make you a better programmer.  <br />

    <scope> is optional

    Example  <br />
    feat: add hat wobble   <br />
    ^--^  ^------------^    <br />
    |     |                  <br />
    |     +-> Summary in present tense.   <br />
    |            <br />
    +-------> Type: chore, docs, feat, fix, refactor, style, or test.    <br />
    More Examples:   <br />

    feat: (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)     <br />
    fix: (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)     <br />
    docs: (changes to the documentation)     <br />
    style: (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)     <br />
